# Dino Run Unity2D ML Agent

The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source project that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. We provide implementations (based on PyTorch) of state-of-the-art algorithms to enable game developers and hobbyists to easily train intelligent agents for 2D, 3D and VR/AR games.

## About Project

The Project is a replica of the google chrome time pass game, the objective was to create an artificial intelligence capable of dodging obstacles. The AI was built and trained with what the ML Agent library provides.

The dinosaur sprite was not created by me, but made available for free, and you can find it by clicking on this [link](https://www.gameart2d.com/free-dino-sprites.html).
